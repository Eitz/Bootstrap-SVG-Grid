# Bootstrap-SVG-Grid
1070 Inkscape grid, edited up to lastest version of Boostrap (3.3.2).

## Warning about Colors
Aparently there's a bug in this version of inkscape that won't let the grid load the predefined colors from the SVG.
They seem to be [fixing it](https://bugs.launchpad.net/inkscape/+bug/1374870).
